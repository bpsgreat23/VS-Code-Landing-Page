                    Visual Studio Code for the Web provides a free, zero-install Microsoft Visual Studio Code experience running entirely in your browser, allowing you to quickly and safely browse source code repositories and make lightweight code changes. To get started, go to <a href="/">https://vscode.dev</a>  in your browser.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: medium;">
                    VS Code for the Web has many of the features of VS Code Desktop that you love, including search and syntax highlighting while browsing and editing, along with extension support to work on your codebase and make simpler edits. In addition to opening repositories, forks, and pull requests from source control providers like GitHub and Azure Repos, you can also work with code that is stored on your local machine.

                    VS Code for the Web runs entirely in your web browser, so there are certain limitations compared to the desktop experience, which you can read more about <a href="/">below.</a>

                    VS Code for the Web provides a browser-based experience for navigating files and repositories and committing lightweight code changes. However, if you need access to a runtime to run, build, or debug your code, you want to use platform features such as a terminal, or you want to run extensions that aren't supported in the web, we recommend moving your work to the desktop application, GitHub Codespaces, or using Remote - Tunnels for the full capabilities of VS Code. In addition, VS Code Desktop lets you use a full set of keyboard shortcuts not limited by your browser.

                    When you're ready to switch, you'll be able to "upgrade" to the full VS Code experience with a few clicks.
                    
                    You can also switch between the Stable and Insiders versions of VS Code for the Web by selecting the gear icon, then Switch to Insiders Version..., or by navigating directly to https://insiders.vscode.dev.                </p>

By navigating to https://vscode.dev, you can create a new local file or project, work on an existing local project, or access source code repositories hosted elsewhere, such as on GitHub and Azure Repos (part of Azure DevOps).

You can create a new local file in the web just as you would in a VS Code Desktop environment, using File > New File from the Command Palette (F1)</p>
